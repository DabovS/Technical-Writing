# Technical-Writing
## Making knowledge comprehensive

One of the challenges that most people face during new concepts is how to turn them into practice and solve a daily task. A good technical writer can guide from A to B while explaining an idea. Even the most complex projects require an approach that follows a frame of collection. Having such template - structural writing makes the thought more clear and sharp. It also helps build the readiness for the editorial process.

Agile methodology is providing a more flexible working environment addressing the "Time for a project to be moved forward".
